# Agentic Trading Documentation

## Overview

The Agentic Trading system provides autonomous, AI-powered trading capabilities for RealizeAlpha. It combines multi-indicator technical analysis with risk management controls to execute trades automatically based on qualified trading signals.

**Auto-Execution:** The system includes a built-in timer that automatically checks for trading opportunities every 5 minutes when auto-trading is enabled. No manual intervention is required - simply enable auto-trading in settings and the system will monitor and execute trades autonomously.

## Architecture

### Components

   - User interface for configuration
   - Real-time status monitoring with countdown timer
   - Auto-save functionality (no manual save button)
   - Emergency stop controls
   - Integration with both AgenticTradingProvider and TradeSignalsProvider

6. **Backend Functions** (`functions/src/`)
   - `riskguardTask`: Advanced risk assessment and validation engine
   - `RiskGuardAgent`: Implements sector limits, correlation checks, and volatility filters
   - Trade signal generation cron jobs (daily, hourly, 15-min)

7. **Search & Discovery Widgets** (`lib/widgets/search_widget.dart`, `screener_widget.dart`, `presets_widget.dart`) *[NEW]*
   - **SearchWidget**: Main entry point for trade signal discovery. Features advanced filtering for signal strength and individual indicators.
   - **ScreenerWidget**: Dedicated stock screener interface for fundamental analysis (Market Cap, P/E, Dividend, etc.).
   - **PresetsWidget**: Quick access to pre-defined Yahoo Finance screeners (e.g., "Undervalued Growth", "Day Gainers").

## Features

### Trade Signal Discovery

The Search tab provides powerful tools to discover and filter trade signals generated by the Agentic Trading system.

**Filtering Capabilities:**
- **Signal Strength Filtering:** Filter signals by overall strength category:
  - **Strong (75-100):** High-confidence setups with multiple confirming indicators.
  - **Moderate (50-74):** Good setups with solid support but fewer confirmations.
  - **Weak (0-49):** Low-confidence or conflicting signals (often used for contrarian analysis).
- **Indicator-Specific Filtering:** Granular control over all 12 indicators. Each indicator chip supports a 4-way toggle:
  - **Off:** No filter applied.
  - **BUY:** Show only signals where this indicator is bullish.
  - **SELL:** Show only signals where this indicator is bearish.
  - **HOLD:** Show only signals where this indicator is neutral.

**Exclusive Filtering Logic:**
To prevent conflicting queries, the system enforces exclusivity between high-level strength filters and granular indicator filters:
- Selecting a **Signal Strength** category (e.g., "Strong") automatically clears any active indicator filters.
- Activating an **Indicator Filter** (e.g., "RSI: BUY") automatically clears the Signal Strength selection.

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Server-Side Filtering:** All filtering logic (strength ranges, indicator states, date ranges) is executed on Firestore to minimize data transfer and client-side processing.
- **Efficient Indexing:** Custom composite indexes support complex queries like "Show me all signals where RSI is BUY and MACD is BUY, sorted by time."

### Automatic Execution

The system automatically executes trades when auto-trading is enabled:

**Timer-Based Execution:**
- Periodic checks every 5 minutes
- Automatically starts when app loads with user data
- Runs continuously while app is active
- Checks `autoTradeEnabled` configuration flag
- Only executes during market hours (validated via MarketHours utility)
- Real-time countdown timer displayed in settings UI

**Execution Cycle:**
1. Timer triggers every 5 minutes
2. Checks if auto-trading is enabled in config
3. Validates market hours using MarketHours.isMarketOpen()
4. Validates required data (user, account, portfolio)
5. Builds current portfolio state
6. Calls `autoTrade()` with all parameters
7. Calls `monitorTakeProfitStopLoss()` for automated trades
8. Updates countdown timer for next cycle

### Custom Indicators

Users can now define their own technical indicators to be used alongside the standard 12-indicator system.

- **Creation:** Define custom logic based on price action, volume, or other available data points.
- **Integration:** Custom indicators are evaluated as part of the signal generation process.
- **Weighting:** Assign specific weights to custom indicators to influence the overall signal strength.

### Advanced Exit Strategies

The system supports sophisticated exit strategies to maximize profits and minimize risks:

- **Partial Exits:** Configure multiple exit targets (e.g., sell 50% at +10% profit, sell remaining 50% at +20%).
- **Time-Based Exits:** Automatically close positions after a specified duration (e.g., 2 hours) if profit targets haven't been met.
- **Market Close Exits:** Automatically liquidate positions a set number of minutes before the market closes to avoid overnight risk.

### ML Optimization

Machine Learning models are integrated to continuously optimize trade signals:

- **Signal Refinement:** ML algorithms analyze historical performance to adjust indicator weights and thresholds.
- **Accuracy Improvement:** Reduces false positives by learning from past market conditions.
- **Adaptive Logic:** The system adapts to changing market volatility and trends.
9. Logs execution results

**Location:** `navigation_widget.dart` - Main navigation widget with access to all services and providers

**UI Integration:**
- Settings widget shows real-time countdown to next check
- App bar displays auto-trade status badge when active
- Status updates propagate via ChangeNotifier pattern

### Auto-Trade Logic

The `autoTrade()` method orchestrates automatic trade execution:

```dart
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> autoTrade({
  required Map<String, dynamic> portfolioState,
}) async
```

**Process Flow:**
1. **Pre-flight Checks** (`_canAutoTrade()`)
   - Verify auto-trade is enabled
   - Check emergency stop status
   - Validate market hours
   - Enforce daily trade limit
   - Verify cooldown period has elapsed
   - Check daily loss limit

2. **Signal Processing**
   - Fetch current trade signals from Firestore
   - Filter for BUY signals
   - Validate signal quality

3. **Trade Execution**
   - Call `initiateTradeProposal()` for each qualified signal
   - Assess risk with `riskguardTask`
   - Track execution history
   - Update counters and timestamps

4. **Post-Trade Actions**
   - Log analytics events
   - Update UI state
   - Enforce rate limiting between trades
   - **Record enabledIndicators snapshot for performance analysis**
   - **Mark trade as real or paper mode**

### Advanced Risk Controls

The system now includes a sophisticated `RiskGuardAgent` that enforces portfolio-level risk management rules before any trade is executed. These controls are configurable in the Agentic Trading Settings.

**Partial Position Exits:**
- **Staged Profit Taking:** Configure multiple exit stages to lock in profits incrementally.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Define profit targets (e.g., +5%, +10%) and the percentage of the position to sell at each stage (e.g., 50%).
- **Example Strategy:** Sell 50% of position at +5% profit, then sell the remaining 50% at +10% profit.
- **Persistence:** Partial exit state is saved to Firestore, ensuring stages are tracked correctly even if the app is restarted.
- **Legacy Support:** Works seamlessly with existing positions (backfills tracking data).

**Stop Loss & Take Profit:**
- **Stop Loss:** Automatically sells position if loss exceeds configured percentage (e.g., -5%).
- **Take Profit:** Automatically sells position if profit exceeds configured percentage (e.g., +10%).
- **Trailing Stop Loss:** Optional dynamic stop loss that follows the price up. If enabled, the stop price is calculated as `Highest Price - Trailing %`. Locks in profits as the stock rises.

**Advanced Risk Controls:**
- **Sector Exposure Limits:** Cap allocation to specific sectors (e.g., max 20% in Technology).
- **Correlation Checks:** Prevent opening new positions that are highly correlated with existing holdings (max correlation coefficient 0.7).
- **Volatility Filters:** Filter trades based on Implied Volatility (IV) rank (min/max thresholds).
- **Drawdown Protection:** Halt trading if portfolio drawdown exceeds a specified percentage.

**Safety Checks:**
- **Daily Trade Limit:** Maximum number of automated trades per day.
- **Cooldown Period:** Minimum time between trades (default 60 mins).
- **Max Daily Loss:** Stops trading if daily loss exceeds threshold.
- **Emergency Stop:** Manual override to immediately halt all auto-trading.
- **Market Hours:** Only trades during regular market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET).

**Key Risk Features:**
- **Sector Exposure Limits:** Prevents over-concentration in a single sector.
  - Configurable `maxSectorExposure` (default 20%).
  - Checks current portfolio allocation before approving new trades.
- **Correlation Checks:** Avoids adding positions that are highly correlated with existing holdings.
  - Configurable `maxCorrelation` coefficient (default 0.7).
  - Helps maintain portfolio diversification.
- **Volatility Filters:** Ensures trades are only taken within acceptable volatility ranges.
  - Configurable `minVolatility` and `maxVolatility` (IV Rank).
  - Prevents trading in extremely low or high volatility environments.
- **Drawdown Protection:** Halts trading if the portfolio experiences significant drawdown.
  - Configurable `maxDrawdown` percentage.
  - Acts as a circuit breaker for the entire trading system.

### Order Approval Workflow

For users who want the benefits of AI signal generation but prefer manual control over execution, the system offers an **Order Approval Workflow**.

**How it works:**
1. **Enable Approval:** Toggle `requireApproval` in Agentic Trading Settings.
2. **Signal Generation:** The system generates trade proposals as usual based on signals and risk checks.
3. **Pending State:** Instead of executing immediately, orders are placed in a "Pending Approval" queue.
4. **Notification:** The user receives a notification about the pending order.
5. **Review & Action:**
   - Users can review pending orders in the Agentic Trading Settings.
   - **Approve:** The order is sent to the brokerage for execution.
   - **Reject:** The order is discarded.
   - **Timeout:** Pending orders may expire if not acted upon within a certain timeframe (configurable).

### Advanced Performance Analytics

**Key Metrics Explained:**

*Sharpe Ratio*
- Measures return vs volatility
- Higher = better risk-adjusted returns
- Used to compare different strategies fairly
- Good >1, Fair 0-1, Poor <0

*Profit Factor*
- Simple profitability measure
- PF > 1 = profitable
- PF > 2 = excellent (2:1 or better win/loss)
- PF < 1 = money losing strategy

*Expectancy*
- Average profit per trade
- Positive expectancy = strategy is profitable
- Crucial for validating trading system
- (Winning trades × Win rate) - (Losing trades × Loss rate)

*Max Drawdown*
- Largest peak-to-trough decline
- Important risk metric
- Helps set stop-loss levels
- Shows portfolio volatility

The `monitorTakeProfitStopLoss()` method automatically exits positions when targets are met:

```dart
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> monitorTakeProfitStopLoss({
  required List<dynamic> positions,
  required brokerageUser,
  required account,
  required brokerageService,
  required instrumentStore,
}) async
```

**Monitoring Flow:**
1. **Position Filtering**
   - Check only positions created by automated trading
   - Positions tracked in `_automatedBuyTrades` list
   - Manual trades and pre-existing positions are NOT monitored

2. **Position Analysis**
   - Iterate through automated trade records
   - Extract entry price and current price
   - Calculate profit/loss percentage using trade record's entry price
   - **Update highestPrice for trailing stop tracking**

3. **Threshold Checks**
   - If P/L >= `takeProfitPercent`: Trigger Take Profit exit
   - If P/L <= -`stopLossPercent`: Trigger Stop Loss exit
   - **If Trailing Stop enabled: Check if price dropped below (highestPrice - trailingStopPercent)**

4. **Order Execution**
   - **Check `paperTradingMode`: Simulate or execute real order**
   - Fetch instrument data for the symbol
   - Place SELL order through brokerage service (or simulate in paper mode)
   - Validate order response (200/201 status)
   - Remove trade record from `_automatedBuyTrades`
   - Track exit in history with reason and P/L%

5. **Analytics & Logging**
   - Log exit execution events
   - Track failures separately
   - Update trade history with paper/real indicator
   - Record exit reason (Take Profit/Stop Loss/Trailing Stop)

6. **Persistence**
   - **Save updated trades list to Firebase after exits**
   - Ensures accuracy across sessions

**Integration:**
- Runs every 5 minutes as part of auto-trade timer
- Executes after checking for new trade entry signals
- Only monitors positions opened by automated trading
- Manual trades remain under user control
- Positions opened before auto-trading was enabled are not affected

**Trade-Level Tracking:**
- When automated BUY order executes: Trade record added to `_automatedBuyTrades`
- Record contains: `{symbol, quantity, entryPrice, timestamp, enabledIndicators, paperMode, highestPrice}`
- When TP/SL/Trailing Stop exit executes: Specific trade record removed
- Manual trades: Never added to tracking, never monitored for TP/SL
- **Stored in Firebase**: `users/{userId}/automated_buy_trades` subcollection
- **Persists across**: App restarts and device changes

**Trailing Stop Loss:**
- **Activated when**: `trailingStopEnabled = true` and `trailingStopPercent` configured
- **Tracks**: `highestPrice` for each automated trade
- **Exits when**: Current price drops more than `trailingStopPercent` below peak
- **Benefit**: Locks in gains while allowing further upside
- **Example**: Entry $100, peak $120, trailing stop 5% → Exit trigger at $114

**Paper Trading Simulation:**
- **`paperTradingMode = true`**: Calls `_simulatePaperOrder()` instead of broker API
- **Creates realistic response**: With all expected fields (id, status, executions)
- **Tracks identically**: Same P/L, analytics, exit reasons
- **Persists to Firebase**: Marked with `paperMode: true` flag
- **Filtered in analytics**: Paper vs real trade comparison available

**Example - Automated Position:**
```
Auto-trade buys: 10 AAPL at $150 → Trade record created
Record: {symbol: 'AAPL', quantity: 10, entryPrice: 150.00, timestamp: '...', enabledIndicators: ['momentum', 'macd'], paperMode: false, highestPrice: 150.00}
Current price: $165 → highestPrice updated to 165.00
P/L = ((165 - 150) / 150) * 100 = 10%

Scenario 1 - Take Profit:
If takeProfitPercent = 10%: Trigger SELL 10 shares
After exit: Trade record removed, analytics updated

Scenario 2 - Trailing Stop:
If trailingStopEnabled = true, trailingStopPercent = 3%
Price rises to $170 (highestPrice = 170.00)
Price drops to $165 (drop = 2.9%, below 3% threshold)
No exit yet

Price drops to $164.80 (drop = 3.05%, exceeds 3% threshold)
Trigger SELL 10 shares at $164.80
Locked in profit from $150 to $164.80
```
````

**Example - Manual + Automated Same Symbol:**
```
User owns: 100 AAPL at $140 (manual, not tracked)
Auto-trade buys: 10 AAPL at $150 (tracked separately)
Current price: $165

For automated trade:
P/L = ((165 - 150) / 150) * 100 = 10%
Action: SELL 10 shares (from automated trade)
Result: Manual 100 shares @ $140 remain untouched
```

**Example - Multiple Automated Trades:**
```
Auto-trade 1: Buy 10 AAPL @ $150 (tracked)
Auto-trade 2: Buy 5 AAPL @ $160 (tracked separately)
Current price: $165

Trade 1 P/L: ((165-150)/150)*100 = 10% → Triggers TP, SELL 10 shares
Trade 2 P/L: ((165-160)/160)*100 = 3.1% → No trigger
Result: Two separate entries, tracked and managed independently
```

### Firebase Persistence

**Automated Buy Trades Storage:**
- **Collection Path**: `users/{userId}/automated_buy_trades`
- **Document Structure**: Each trade as a separate document
- **Fields**: 
  - `symbol`: Stock symbol (string)
  - `quantity`: Number of shares (int)
  - `entryPrice`: Entry price per share (double)
  - `timestamp`: Execution time (ISO string)
  - `enabledIndicators`: Active indicators at trade time (List<String>) *(v1.3)*
  - `paperMode`: Whether trade was simulated (bool) *(v1.3)*
  - `highestPrice`: Peak price for trailing stop tracking (double) *(v1.3)*
- **Security Rules**: Updated firestore.rules to allow read/write for authenticated users

**Automatic Saving:**
- Trades saved immediately after BUY order execution
- Trades removed immediately after TP/SL/Trailing Stop exit
- Ensures data integrity across app restarts
- Field validation on load for data integrity
- **Paper trades**: Persisted identically to real trades (marked with `paperMode: true`)

**Loading:**
- Trades loaded on user login (via `loadAutomatedBuyTradesFromFirestore`)
- Automatic sync across devices
- Enables continuous TP/SL monitoring across sessions
- Try-catch error handling for robustness
- Validates all required fields when loading

**Benefits:**
- **Persistence**: Survives app crashes and restarts
- **Cross-Device**: User logs in on different device, trades sync
- **Reliability**: Firebase ensures data availability
- **History**: Complete audit trail of automated trades
- **Security**: Firestore rules protect user data
- **Analytics**: enabledIndicators enable performance analysis by indicator combination
- **Paper Tracking**: Separates paper and real trades for comparison

**Example Workflow:**
```
Session 1:
- User enables auto-trading in Paper Mode
- Auto-trade buys 3 positions
- Trades saved to Firebase with paperMode: true and enabledIndicators snapshot

App restart:
- User logs in
- Trades loaded from Firebase automatically
- TP/SL monitoring resumes seamlessly
- Analytics filters show Paper trades separately

Switch to Real Mode:
- User disables Paper Mode
- Next trades execute with paperMode: false
- Analytics now show both paper and real performance
- Can compare strategy effectiveness

Device switch:
- User logs in on new device (tablet)
- All trades sync from Firebase
- Full functionality restored instantly
- Analytics updated with latest metrics
```

**Trade Record Example:**
```json
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "quantity": 10,
  "entryPrice": 150.25,
  "timestamp": "2025-12-13T14:30:45.123Z",
  "enabledIndicators": ["momentum", "macd", "volume"],
  "paperMode": false,
  "highestPrice": 155.50
}
```

### Provider Architecture

**Separation of Concerns:**

The recent refactoring (commit 861f2bc) introduced a cleaner architecture with separated responsibilities:

1. **TradeSignalsProvider**:
   - **Purpose**: Centralized signal management
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Fetch trade signals from Firestore
     - Real-time signal listeners
     - Provide indicator documentation
     - Market status checking
   - **Usage**: InstrumentWidget, SearchWidget, etc.

2. **AgenticTradingProvider**:
   - **Purpose**: Trade execution and automation
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Auto-trade execution logic
     - TP/SL monitoring
     - Trade tracking (automated buy trades)
     - Firebase persistence
     - Risk management
   - **Usage**: NavigationWidget (timer), SettingsWidget

3. **MarketHours Utility**:

     - DST-aware Eastern Time conversion
     - Weekend detection
     - Market hours validation (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
   - **Usage**: Both providers and widgets

**Benefits of Refactoring:**
- **Modularity**: Each provider has a single, clear purpose
- **Reusability**: TradeSignalsProvider used across multiple widgets
- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify signal fetching without affecting execution
- **Testability**: Unit test individual components in isolation
- **Performance**: Optimized signal subscriptions and market checks

### Risk Management Controls

- **Behavior**: Trades are blocked until cooldown expires

#### Maximum Daily Loss
- **Config Field**: `maxDailyLossPercent` (default: 2.0%)
- **Purpose**: Stops trading if losses exceed threshold
- **Status**: Configuration field available; enforcement requires portfolio P&L tracking integration (planned enhancement)

#### Emergency Stop
- **Activation**: Via UI button or API call
- **Effect**: Immediately halts all auto-trading
- **Persistence**: Remains active until manually deactivated
- **Use Case**: Market volatility, system issues, or user intervention

- **Config Field**: `maxPortfolioConcentration` (default: 50%)
- **Purpose**: Prevents over-concentration in single positions
- **Calculation**: Position value / total portfolio value

#### Take Profit
- **Config Field**: `takeProfitPercent` (default: 10.0%)
- **Purpose**: Automatically exits positions when profit target is reached
- **Calculation**: `((currentPrice - entryPrice) / entryPrice) * 100`
- **Behavior**: When position P/L >= takeProfitPercent, system executes SELL order
- **Scope**: Only applies to positions opened by automated trading
- **Use Case**: Lock in profits automatically without manual monitoring

#### Stop Loss
- **Config Field**: `stopLossPercent` (default: 5.0%)
- **Purpose**: Automatically exits positions to limit losses
- **Calculation**: `((currentPrice - entryPrice) / entryPrice) * 100`
- **Behavior**: When position P/L <= -stopLossPercent, system executes SELL order
- **Scope**: Only applies to positions opened by automated trading
- **Use Case**: Protect capital by automatically cutting losing positions

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Location: `test/agentic_trading_*_test.dart`

**Test Files:**
1. `agentic_trading_config_test.dart` - Configuration model tests
2. `agentic_trading_provider_test.dart` - Provider logic tests  
3. `agentic_trading_settings_widget_test.dart` - UI widget tests *[NEW]*

**Coverage:**
- Configuration serialization/deserialization
- Backward compatibility with old configs
- State management and change notifications
- Risk control enforcement (limits, cooldowns)
- Emergency stop functionality
- Daily limit tracking
- **Auto-save functionality in settings widget** *[NEW]*
- **Indicator toggle persistence** *[NEW]*
- **UI state updates and validation** *[NEW]*

**Run Tests:**
```bash
# All agentic trading tests
flutter test test/agentic_trading_config_test.dart
flutter test test/agentic_trading_provider_test.dart
flutter test test/agentic_trading_settings_widget_test.dart

# Or run all at once
flutter test test/ --name="agentic"
```

**New Widget Tests (commit 861f2bc):**
- Tests auto-save behavior when toggling indicators
- Validates settings persistence to Firestore
- Tests UI rendering with different provider states
- Validates form field updates and validation

### Integration Testing
Recommended approach:
1. Use paper trading mode
2. Test with small position sizes
3. Monitor execution closely
4. Validate risk controls
5. Test emergency stop

## Security Considerations

### Configuration Storage
- User configs stored in Firestore
- Access controlled by security rules
- No sensitive API keys in client code
- **Updated Firestore rules** for `automated_buy_trades` collection *[NEW]*

### Trade Execution
- Server-side validation required (initiateTradeProposal, riskguardTask)
- Risk assessment before execution
- Emergency stop accessible from client
- All trades authenticated and authorized

### Firebase Security Rules
```
// New rules for automated buy trades (commit 861f2bc)
match /users/{userId}/automated_buy_trades/{tradeId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

### Rate Limiting
- Backend rate limiting on Cloud Functions
- Client-side cooldowns (2-second delay between trades)
- Daily limits prevent runaway trading
- Market hours enforcement prevents off-hours trading

## Best Practices

### Initial Setup
1. Start with conservative limits (1-2 trades/day)
2. Use longer cooldown periods (60+ minutes)
3. Set tight loss limits (1-2%)
4. Monitor closely for first week

### Risk Management
1. Never risk more than 2% of portfolio per day
2. Keep position sizes small relative to portfolio
3. Maintain portfolio diversification
4. Use emergency stop if uncertain

### Monitoring
1. Check trade history daily
2. Review rejected proposals
3. Adjust indicators based on performance
4. Monitor analytics events

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Market Volatility**: Activate emergency stop
2. **System Issues**: Disable auto-trade, investigate
3. **Unexpected Behavior**: Stop immediately, review logs

## Analytics Events

The system logs the following events:

- `agentic_trading_toggled`: Master switch changed
- `agentic_trading_auto_executed`: Auto-trade completed
- `agentic_trading_auto_error`: Auto-trade failed
- `agentic_trading_auto_failed`: System error
- `agentic_trading_emergency_stop`: Emergency stop activated
- `agentic_trading_emergency_stop_deactivated`: Resumed
- `agentic_trading_trade_approved`: Manual proposal approved
- `agentic_trading_trade_rejected`: Manual proposal rejected

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Push Notifications**: Alert on auto-trade executions
2. **Performance Tracking**: Win/loss ratio, P&L analytics
3. **Backtesting**: Historical strategy simulation
4. **Machine Learning**: Adaptive indicator weighting
5. **Advanced Orders**: Stop-loss, take-profit automation
6. **Portfolio Rebalancing**: Automatic position adjustment

### Under Consideration
- Multi-asset support (options, crypto, futures)
- Strategy templates (conservative, aggressive, balanced)
- Social trading integration (copy successful traders)
- Custom indicator creation
- Strategy sharing with investor groups

## Troubleshooting

### Auto-Trade Not Executing

**Check:**
1. Is `autoTradeEnabled` true in settings?
2. Is emergency stop activated?
3. Is market currently open?
4. Have you reached daily trade limit?
5. Is cooldown period active?
6. Are there any BUY signals available?

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check provider state: `provider.isAutoTrading`
2. Review `_canAutoTrade()` conditions
3. Verify trade signals: `provider.tradeSignals`
4. Check analytics logs for error events

### Trades Being Rejected

**Common Causes:**
1. Risk assessment failure (position too large)
2. Portfolio concentration limit exceeded
3. Insufficient funds
4. Invalid price data
5. Brokerage API errors

**Resolution:**
1. Review `lastAssessment` for rejection reason
2. Adjust position sizes or limits
3. Check brokerage account status
4. Verify market data availability

### Emergency Stop Not Working

**Verification:**
1. Check `provider.emergencyStopActivated` state
2. Verify UI shows emergency status
3. Test with manual toggle in settings

**If Issue Persists:**
1. Restart app
2. Check Firestore config sync
3. Review error logs

## Integration Examples

### Basic Setup (New Architecture)

**In main.dart:**
```dart
MultiProvider(
  providers: [
    // New: TradeSignalsProvider for signal management
    ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => TradeSignalsProvider(),
    ),
    // Existing: AgenticTradingProvider for execution
    ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => AgenticTradingProvider(),
    ),
    // ... other providers
  ],
  child: MaterialApp(/* ... */),
)
```

### Fetching Trade Signals (TradeSignalsProvider)

**In any widget:**
```dart
// Access the provider
final tradeSignalsProvider = Provider.of<TradeSignalsProvider>(context);

// Fetch signals for a symbol
await tradeSignalsProvider.fetchTradeSignals(
  symbol: 'AAPL',
  interval: '1d',
  userDocRef: userDocRef,
);

// Access the signals
final signals = tradeSignalsProvider.signals;
```

### Executing Auto-Trade (AgenticTradingProvider)

**From navigation widget (timer integration):**
```dart
final agenticProvider = Provider.of<AgenticTradingProvider>(context, listen: false);
final accountStore = Provider.of<AccountStore>(context, listen: false);
final instrumentStore = Provider.of<InstrumentStore>(context, listen: false);

final result = await agenticProvider.autoTrade(
  portfolioState: {
    'equity': portfolioStore.equity,
    'cash': accountStore.items.first.portfolioCash,
    // ... other portfolio data
  },
  brokerageUser: currentUser,
  account: accountStore.items.first,
  brokerageService: brokerageService,
  instrumentStore: instrumentStore,
  userDocRef: userDocRef,  // For Firebase persistence
);
```

### Monitoring TP/SL

**From navigation widget (timer integration):**
```dart
final positions = portfolioStore.positions;

final result = await agenticProvider.monitorTakeProfitStopLoss(
  positions: positions,
  brokerageUser: currentUser,
  account: accountStore.items.first,
  brokerageService: brokerageService,
  instrumentStore: instrumentStore,
  userDocRef: userDocRef,  // For Firebase persistence
);
```

### Checking Market Hours

**Using MarketHours utility:**
```dart
import 'package:robinhood_options_mobile/utils/market_hours.dart';

if (MarketHours.isMarketOpen()) {
  // Market is open, proceed with trading
  print('✅ Market is open');
} else {
  // Market is closed
  print('❌ Market is closed');
}
```

### Settings Widget Integration

**Navigate to settings:**
```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => AgenticTradingSettingsWidget(
      user: currentUser,
      userDocRef: userDocRef,
    ),
  ),
);
```

**Settings now auto-save** - no manual save button needed. Every change is persisted immediately to Firestore.

### SliverAppBar Status Badge

**The refactored SliverAppBar now shows auto-trade status:**
```dart
// Automatically displays when auto-trading is active
// Shows countdown timer
// Tapping navigates to settings
// No manual integration needed - built into SliverAppBar
```
