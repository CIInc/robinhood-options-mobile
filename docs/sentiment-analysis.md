# Market Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

RealizeAlpha now includes a comprehensive **Market Sentiment Analysis** module designed to gauge the overall mood of the market. This feature leverages AI and quantitative data to provide a "Bullish", "Bearish", or "Neutral" outlook, helping traders align their strategies with the broader market direction.

## Features

### Market Sentiment Card
Located on the main search and home dashboards, this card provides an at-a-glance view of the current market sentiment.
- **Visual Gauge:** A color-coded indicator (Green for Bullish, Red for Bearish, Grey for Neutral).
- **Key Drivers:** A summary of the top factors influencing the current sentiment (e.g., "Tech Sector Rally", "Fed Rate Decision").

### Sentiment Analysis Dashboard
A dedicated dashboard for deeper analysis.
- **Detailed Metrics:** Breakdown of sentiment by sector and asset class.
- **Historical Trend:** A chart showing how sentiment has shifted over the last week or month.
- **News Integration:** Linked news stories that are driving the sentiment score.

## How It Works
The sentiment score is derived from a combination of:
1.  **Price Action:** Technical analysis of major indices (SPY, QQQ, IWM).
2.  **Options Flow:** Put/Call ratios and "smart money" flow analysis.
3.  **News & Social:** AI-aggregated sentiment from financial news headlines and social signals.

## Usage
Use the Market Sentiment Analysis to:
- **Confirm Trends:** Look for alignment between your trade ideas and the broad market sentiment.
- **Risk Management:** tightening stops or reducing size when sentiment opposes your position.
- **Contrarian Trading:** Identify potential reversals when sentiment reaches extreme levels.
